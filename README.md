## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
For this project, the main goal is to make booking as simple and smooth as possible. The app should feel easy to use, look consistent across all pages, and work well on any device. Since most users browse on their phones, a mobile-first approach is important. We also want fast loading times and a clean, accessible layout so anyone can use the platform comfortably.

### Key Features
- Search and filter properties by location, price, and other details.  
- View complete property information with images, price, and reviews.  
- Book properties through a secure and simple checkout process.  
- Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.  
- Use reusable UI components (like cards, navbars, and forms) for consistency.

### Main Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Property Listing** | A grid of available properties with options to filter results by price, location, etc. |
| **Property Details** | A full view of one property, including images, description, amenities, price, and a booking form. |
| **Checkout** | A simple, secure page to confirm bookings and handle payments. |

### Why a User-Friendly Design Matters
A booking system only works if people actually enjoy using it. If the design is confusing or slow, users will leave and book elsewhere. On the other hand, a clear layout, smooth navigation, and consistent design build trust and keep users engaged. The easier the process, the more likely people are to complete their bookings and come back again

### Design Properties from Figma

While exploring the Figma file for this project, we identified the following design properties that will guide the frontend implementation:

#### üé® Color Styles
- **Primary:** #FF5A5F  
- **Secondary:** #008489  
- **Background:** #FFFFFF  
- **Text:** #222222  
- **Secondary Text:** #717171  

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Typography
- **Primary Font:** Circular  
- **Headings:** Bold (700), 24px‚Äì32px  
- **Body Text:** Medium (500), 16px  
- **Secondary Text:** Book (400), 14px

### Why This Matters
Identifying colors, fonts, and sizes early on makes sure the design stays consistent across the whole application. Without this step, different team members might pick slightly different shades or font sizes, and the app would feel messy or unpolished. By sticking to the same design properties from the mockup, we save time, keep the UI clean, and ensure the final product looks professional and easy to use.
