## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
For this project, the main goal is to make booking as simple and smooth as possible. The app should feel easy to use, look consistent across all pages, and work well on any device. Since most users browse on their phones, a mobile-first approach is important. We also want fast loading times and a clean, accessible layout so anyone can use the platform comfortably.

### Key Features
- Search and filter properties by location, price, and other details.  
- View complete property information with images, price, and reviews.  
- Book properties through a secure and simple checkout process.  
- Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.  
- Use reusable UI components (like cards, navbars, and forms) for consistency.

### Main Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Property Listing** | A grid of available properties with options to filter results by price, location, etc. |
| **Property Details** | A full view of one property, including images, description, amenities, price, and a booking form. |
| **Checkout** | A simple, secure page to confirm bookings and handle payments. |

### Why a User-Friendly Design Matters
A booking system only works if people actually enjoy using it. If the design is confusing or slow, users will leave and book elsewhere. On the other hand, a clear layout, smooth navigation, and consistent design build trust and keep users engaged. The easier the process, the more likely people are to complete their bookings and come back again

### Design Properties from Figma

While exploring the Figma file for this project, we identified the following design properties that will guide the frontend implementation:

#### üé® Color Styles
- **Primary:** #FF5A5F  
- **Secondary:** #008489  
- **Background:** #FFFFFF  
- **Text:** #222222  
- **Secondary Text:** #717171  

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Typography
- **Primary Font:** Circular  
- **Headings:** Bold (700), 24px‚Äì32px  
- **Body Text:** Medium (500), 16px  
- **Secondary Text:** Book (400), 14px

### Why This Matters
Identifying colors, fonts, and sizes early on makes sure the design stays consistent across the whole application. Without this step, different team members might pick slightly different shades or font sizes, and the app would feel messy or unpolished. By sticking to the same design properties from the mockup, we save time, keep the UI clean, and ensure the final product looks professional and easy to use.

## Project Roles and Responsibilities

Building a full-stack application like this takes teamwork. To keep everything organized, we‚Äôve broken down the main roles and what each one brings to the table:

### üë©‚Äçüíº Project Manager
- Keeps track of deadlines and deliverables.  
- Coordinates communication between team members.  
- Makes sure the project moves forward smoothly without losing focus.  

### üíª Frontend Developers
- Implement the user interface based on the Figma designs.  
- Build reusable UI components (navbar, property cards, forms, etc.).  
- Ensure the app looks good on all devices through responsive design.  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Developers
- Set up the database and server-side logic.  
- Build APIs that handle authentication, property listings, and bookings.  
- Make sure data is secure and the system performs efficiently.  

### üé® Designers
- Define the visual language: colors, typography, layouts.  
- Maintain design consistency across all screens.  
- Work closely with frontend devs to turn mockups into reality.  

### üß™ QA / Testers
- Write test cases and test different features of the app.  
- Catch bugs before they reach production.  
- Ensure the overall experience is reliable and smooth.  

### üöÄ DevOps Engineers
- Handle deployment and hosting of the app.  
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automatic builds and testing.  
- Monitor performance and keep everything running in production.  

### üß≠ Product Owner
- Represents the stakeholders and end users.  
- Defines requirements and priorities for features.  
- Makes sure the final product aligns with the project vision.  

### üåÄ Scrum Master
- Facilitates stand-ups and sprint planning sessions.  
- Helps remove blockers that slow the team down.  
- Keeps the team aligned with agile practices.

### Why Roles Matter
Clear responsibilities prevent overlap and confusion. Each role ensures a different part of the project is handled properly ‚Äî from design to code, testing to deployment. Together, these roles create a workflow that allows the team to deliver a professional, working product on time.
