## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
For this project, the main goal is to make booking as simple and smooth as possible. The app should feel easy to use, look consistent across all pages, and work well on any device. Since most users browse on their phones, a mobile-first approach is important. We also want fast loading times and a clean, accessible layout so anyone can use the platform comfortably.

### Why a User-Friendly Design Matters
A booking system only works if people actually enjoy using it. If the design is confusing or slow, users will leave and book elsewhere. On the other hand, a clear layout, smooth navigation, and consistent design build trust and keep users engaged. The easier the process, the more likely people are to complete their bookings and come back again.
